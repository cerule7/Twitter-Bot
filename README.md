# Twitter-Bot
Uses twitter4j and Markov chains to generate random tweets from text files. 
Markov chain code adapted from Daniel Friedman, 2011: https://github.com/dan-f/Markov-Text-Generator

**Note: You must modify the directory paths in myBot.java, textGenerator.java and frequencyCounter.java so the computer can find the material files. You must add in the API tokens for your bot in myBot.java. You must have twitter4j installed and imported into your library.**
