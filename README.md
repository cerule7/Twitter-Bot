# Twitter-Bot
Uses twitter4j and Markov chain text generation to generate and post tweets. 
Markov text chain generation is based on Daniel Friedman's code, located at https://github.com/dan-f/Markov-Text-Generator/. 


**Note: You must modify the directory paths in myBot.java so the computer can find the material files, and input the Twitter API keys for the bot.**

Here is an example bot: https://twitter.com/charliebot666
